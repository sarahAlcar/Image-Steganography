# Image-Steganography

The algorithm was implemented in Python in version 2.7.12. All operations are implemented in three different files called "convert.py", "find_msg.py" and "evd_pxl.py". The program can be executed by terminal, execute the python convert.py command to do the steganography, python find_msg.py to read the text and python evd_pxl.py to highlight the changed pixels.As soon as steganography starts, the input is the name of the image, later the text file and finally the bit steganography position (ex. "monalisa.png" will be "monalisa", "text.txt" will be "text" and (0,1,2, ..., 7). For the other scripts, only the name of the output image and the bit band (eg "monalisa_outfile.png" will be "monalisa_outfile" and (0,1,2, ..., 7)). The program is executed with images in PNG format only. The partial results of the operations are stored in the folder that contains the scripts. All saved images have PNG extension.
